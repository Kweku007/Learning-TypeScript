# Learning-TypeScript

learning typescript on youtube

Typescript is compiled into Javascript code. Advantage is that it is type casted, enabling code with less compilation errors

## Typscript Core Types

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Object
5. Array
6. Tuple - need to explicitly override type since inference would not be able to work. Tuple functionality is broken with "push"
7. Enum
8. Any
9. Union
10. Literal
11. Type Alias
12. Functions
13. Unknown
14. Never

NB: Typescript has a type inference feature which is useful

Video does not really have a project where you can code along so most important document would be this readme to jot down everything I'm learning from the video
